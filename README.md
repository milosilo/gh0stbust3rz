# Gh0stbust3rz: The Game

## About
Welcome to **Gh0stbust3rz: The Game**, an exhilarating and interactive experience that not only teaches you essential tech skills but also guides you through building a Command and Control (C2) system, Netino C2, one piece at a time!

## Workshops
The game consists of several workshops designed to equip you with the skills needed to become a Gh0stbust3r and build your own C2:

1. **Server Setup Workshop**: 
    - Learn how to set up a server and understand IPs and ports.
    - Real Code Example: 
    ```python
    server_ip = '127.0.0.1'
    server_port = 8080
    ```

2. **Network Navigation Workshop**: 
    - Understand network protocols and routing.
    - Real Code Example: 
    ```python
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((server_ip, server_port))
    ```

3. **Proton Pack Programming**: 
    - Code your proton pack for ghostbusting.

4. **Red Team Exercises**: 
    - Test your C2 against simulated network defenses.

5. **Final Assembly Room**: 
    - Assemble all the components you've gathered.
